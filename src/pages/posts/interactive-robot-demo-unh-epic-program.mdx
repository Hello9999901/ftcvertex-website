Over the summer, our day student team members Vincent and Penny volunteered for the University of New Hampshire’s EPIC Program. This program allows elementary and middle school students to learn coding skills through LEGO Mindstorms and Arduino microcomputers. Vincent, the counseling manager for the program, hosted an interactive robot session in which he brought in our robot from the Rover Ruckus season. The children got to learn about the game and the robot, ask questions, and even drive it around!

Through this demonstration session, many students developed an interest in FIRST robotics, and many went on to join the FIRST Lego League team that our team now hosts!
