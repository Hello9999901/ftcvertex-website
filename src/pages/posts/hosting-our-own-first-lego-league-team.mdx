Many kids who attended the UNH EPIC camp over the summer wanted to continue their exploration in robotics. The local elementary school only had limited team space and hours that did not work for many of the kids. So, we decided to start “STARK Industries”, FLL team number 48140. Due to the lack of a community space Kai, the head coach and mentor, leads the team out of their families dining room every Sunday morning. The team is comprised of seven 4th to 6th graders. None of the kids have any robotics experience prior to the UNH EPIC camp. Although the learning curve is steep every week the kids seem eager to learn about coopertition, with meetings starting out with a challenge similar to those teams will be asked to complete in core values judging, along with other robotics principles.
