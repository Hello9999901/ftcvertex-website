We were invited by Mr. Ken St. Hilaire to present at the 24 Hours International STEM Festival. We talked about the importance of the **engineering design process**, and went through the **basics of Odometry**, a robot tracking system that we use, but is used only by the highest level teams. We wanted to introduce such advanced concepts to more teams, in hopes that more teams will be able to learn and implement even smarter systems to their robots.

It was really fun to present at this festival, and we were joined by other presenters like Ken St. Hilaire and Karthik Kanagasabapathy! We got many **positive comments**, and Ken told us that he and the other organizers loved our presentation and learned a lot about Odometry! This was great news for us, as our goal was to make this very useful system **more accessible to everyone.**
