The foundation of our robot is our odometry system. It is able to track our robot's position and heading in real time, giving us valuable data that we can use in conjunction with other tools such as motion profiling and pathfinding.

In this presentation, our Chief Technical Officer, Vincent Xiao, covers the basics of such a system and its application in robotics. This presentation first aired during the (virtual) 24 Hours of STEM International Festival.
