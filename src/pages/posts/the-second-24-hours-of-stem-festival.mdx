At the 24 Hours International STEM Festival, we presented about **Emotional AI**, an up and coming field in AI that STEM enthusiasts would be interested in. Our goal was to expand the outlook of other robotics enthusiasts to the larger field of STEM. We discussed the basics of what emotional AI is, applications of emotional AI and industries of growth, and the future of the field. We also answered a Q&A on both emotional AI and about our FTC team. The audience was very engaged with our presentation.
