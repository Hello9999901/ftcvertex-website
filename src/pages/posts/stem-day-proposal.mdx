# **Overview**

After 237 years of history, amidst the eager anticipation of all students, there is finally a day at PEA where students interested in the domains of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math can show off their talents and intelligence -- the first PEA STEM Day.

The first STEM Day is going to be held on Sunday, Jan. 27th. It is where people can learn more about STEM clubs at Exeter and enjoy the fun brought by technology. Clubs will be involved to showcase their projects and presenters will be invited to present horizon-widening views. We will also host fun, STEM-related competitions to show off the spirit of STEM-letes on campus.

## Speakers/STEM Forum

Do you want to see what STEM will be like in 10 years or possibly 5? Then come to Tech Forum the intersection of ideas and those who bring those ideas into the world. In the brief period of 20 minutes you will be dazzled, amazed, and surprised as you learn about the pioneers of STEM and their ideas.

If you want to have a chance to present your ideas or projects, come to the STEM Forum. The presentations at STEM Forum are given in the form of Ted Talks. Each presentation is 20 minutes per person. It needs to be shortened, memorable and of outstanding quality. Can’t wait to be a presenter? Please sign up here:

## Tech Faire

During the Tech Faire, people can walk around to survey the variety of projects being presented by clubs or individual students. From cutting-edge designs to arts and crafts tables, what is presented during Tech Faire can stretch to the limits of your imagination. Prepare to have your horizon widened as you see not only what STEM can do for people but what people can do for STEM.

For clubs, this is not only a great chance to show off your achievements but also a precious opportunity to attract new club members.
